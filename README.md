# Arabic-Roman.website

## Description
This project is a website that converts Roman numerals to Arabic numerals and vice versa. It uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a simple and user-friendly interface. The website is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed at https://www.romanarabic.com/.

The motivation for this project was to practice web development skills and learn how to use GitHub Pages. The website solves the problem of converting between two different number systems that are still used today. I learned how to write algorithms for conversion, how to use regular expressions for validation, and how to deploy a website using GitHub.
